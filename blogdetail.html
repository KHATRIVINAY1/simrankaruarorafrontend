                  If you are in the web development industry, you might have
                  definitely come across or possess hands-on experience working
                  with Node.js. This technology has made it possible for web
                  developers to leverage JavaScript for
                  <a
                    href="https://www.techgeekbuzz.com/blog/what-is-back-end-development/"

                  >.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Ryan Dahl, in 2009, launched the most basic version of
                  Node.js. Since then, this technology has emerged as one of the
                  most popular ones for the back-end development of different
                  types of applications.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Many leading tech giants, from LinkedIn to Netflix and PayPal,
                  leverage Node.js to build high-quality, scalable applications.
                  According to the
                  <a href="https://webtribunal.net/blog/node-js-stats/#gref"
                    >reports</a
                  >, 43% of developers use this technology for developing
                  enterprise applications, while 85% of developers use it for
                  web applications.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  This article aims at explaining to you what different types of
                  applications you can develop using this back-end technology,
                  Node.js. But before that, let us have an in-depth look at what
                  exactly Node.js is and why it is used for building scalable
                  applications.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  So, we shall move further into the details without any
                  delay.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <h2><strong>What is Node.js?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

                <p>
                  It is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime
                  environment. It is a lightweight, fast, and scalable back-end
                  runtime environment that runs on top of JavaScript or the
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)"
                    >V8 engine</a
                  >. Developers can use it to execute JavaScript code outside of
                  a browser.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Additionally, programmers may utilize this environment to
                  write server-side scripts and command-line utilities.
                  Server-side scripting includes executing scripts server-side
                  to create dynamic web page content even before sending that
                  web page to users&rsquo; browsers.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  As a result, &ldquo; JavaScript Everywhere&rdquo; is a
                  paradigm that Node.js follows. This means that by using a
                  single language,
                  <a href="https://www.techgeekbuzz.com/tutorial/javascript/"
                    >JavaScript</a
                  >, client-side (front-end) as well as server-side (back-end)
                  development is possible.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  In addition to supporting asynchronous I/O, this runtime
                  environment has an
                  <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture"
                    >event-driven design</a
                  >. This architectural pattern emphasizes optimizing throughput
                  and scalability in real-time and web applications with
                  multiple I/O operations.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here are two important facts about Node.js that you must know:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    It is not any back-end language or framework; instead, it is
                    a runtime environment for JavaScript.&nbsp;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Many people believe that this technology is only utilized
                    for creating servers. However, this is untrue because you
                    can use it for client-side as well as server-side
                    development.&nbsp;
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>
                  <strong
                    >Why Use Node.js to build Scalable Network
                    Applications?&nbsp;</strong
                  >
                </h3>

                <p>
                  This runtime environment was primarily designed for creating
                  high-quality and scalable network applications. Here are some
                  of its significant features that help us understand why it is
                  used for building scalable network applications:&nbsp;
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h4><strong>V8 Engine</strong></h4>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Developed by the Chromium Project, V8 is an open-source
                  JavaScript engine for Google Chrome and Chromium browsers.
                  This engine is capable of converting JavaScript code directly
                  into the native machine code without the need to execute it.
                  This, in turn, results in amazing runtime performance. Along
                  with Node.js, other runtime environments that run on top of
                  this engine are Deno and Qt Quick.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h4><strong>Asynchronous</strong></h4>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Being asynchronous, this runtime environment is capable of
                  handling multiple requests without any dependencies between
                  them. This asynchronous feature helps in boosting the
                  efficiency and throughput of applications. It is also referred
                  to as a non-blocking code execution design pattern.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Unfortunately,
                  <a href="https://www.techgeekbuzz.com/blog/what-is-php/"
                    >PHP</a
                  >
                  does not work like this. It can only handle one request at
                  once; it cannot handle several requests simultaneously.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h4><strong>Single-Threaded&nbsp;</strong></h4>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  This runtime environment has the ability to manage multiple
                  concurrent requests without creating several threads because
                  it uses the single-threaded event loop model. So, there is no
                  need to worry about errors rising due to incorrect thread
                  synchronization, as such errors are extremely challenging to
                  troubleshoot. In addition, this single-threaded model reduces
                  the performance hit of thread context switching.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h4><strong>Unified API</strong></h4>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Node.js has adopted multiple popular back-end development
                  patterns. As a consequence, it is simple to integrate a
                  JSON-compatible browser or database with Node.js, which
                  results in a single JS development stack.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h4><strong>Data Streams&nbsp;</strong></h4>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Applications developed using Node.js do not buffer any data.
                  It is because of the Stream module, which is an interface
                  available to deal with streaming data. This module makes it
                  painless to create objects that implement the stream
                  interface.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Node.js is well suited for developing scalable network
                  applications as it comes with the ability to produce the
                  output in chunks.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <h2><strong>What is Node.js Used for?</strong></h2>

                <p>
                  This runtime environment has proved to be beneficial in
                  developing applications that leverage JavaScript for both
                  front and backend development. According to
                  <a
                    href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies"
                    >Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022</a
                  >, Node.js is the top technology used by half of the
                  respondents, as shown in the image below:&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now that you know what Node.js is and how popular it is. Let
                  us now dive into the list of types of applications that you
                  can develop using this widely-used runtime environment.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h3><strong>Real-Time Chat Applications</strong></h3>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  A real-time application (RTA) is a type of application that
                  operates within the given time frame that users sense as
                  immediate or close to it. Real-time chat applications are
                  those that enable users to communicate live with others
                  through the transmission of text, audio, or video. Instant
                  Messaging (<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging"
                    >IM</a
                  >) or Internet Relay Chat (<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"
                    >IRC</a
                  >) technologies form the basis for real-time chat
                  applications.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Whether it is a social networking site or a commercial
                  website, you can use Node.js to develop any real-time chat
                  application. The event-driven and asynchronous features of
                  this runtime environment make it possible to handle heavy I/O
                  operations. It helps developers build high-performance
                  applications that every user seeks from contemporary real-time
                  chat applications.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Moreover, the Socket.io library enables event-based,
                  real-time, and bidirectional communication between a
                  user&rsquo;s browser and the server. With just around 30 lines
                  of code, developers can group-chat applications using this
                  library.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h3><strong>Streaming Applications</strong></h3>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  A streaming application is a kind of software program that
                  installs only the essential components or portions of an
                  application on demand rather than installing them on the
                  device in advance. Such applications are the form of on-demand

                <p>
                  Once you download content from streaming applications, you can
                  view them even if you are offline. The best example of
                  streaming applications developed using Node.js is
                  Netflix.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Stream API and asynchronous non-blocking I/O of Node.js
                  make it the most popular choice for developing streaming
                  applications. This environment comes with a thorough interface
                  of readable and writable streams that are easy to control and
                  process efficiently.&nbsp;

                </ul>

                <p>
                  A browser game is basically a video game that is played inside
                  a web browser using an internet connection. Another popular
                  type of application developing Node.js is a browser game.
                  However, it utilizes other technologies, such as HTML and
                  Socket.io, to develop single as well as multiplayer games that
                  you can play from a browser, not requiring you to install any
                  third-party plugins.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Moreover, this environment makes the development of
                  multiplayer browser games painless by providing multiple
                  tools. Among these tools, one is EventEmitter, which raises
                  and handles custom events.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h3>
                      <strong
                        ><a

                      >
                    </h3>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  A single-page application (SPA) is a kind of web application
                  that dynamically updates the current web page with new content
                  from the
                  <a
                    href="https://www.techgeekbuzz.com/blog/what-is-web-server/"
                    >web server</a
                  >. Such applications do not involve reloading web pages. Only
                  at the first user request a browser loads a web page, and on
                  subsequent user requests, only the new resources get loaded
                  and added to the web page dynamically.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  The best example of SPA is Gmail. The ability of Node.js to
                  handle heavy input/output workloads and asynchronous calls
                  makes it a perfect choice for developing SPAs.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Moreover, this runtime environment has the ability to delay
                  multiple client requests at once, thanks to its event loop
                  feature. As a result, it guarantees a smooth transition and
                  constant updates to the data.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  The fact that Node.js uses and is built in JavaScript makes it
                  simple to utilize it for developing SPAs because developers
                  can use the same language and data structure for both
                  front-end and back-end development.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h3><strong>Command-Line Applications</strong></h3>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Another type of application that you can develop using Node.js
                  is a command-line application. It is a sort of application
                  that has a text-based interface and lacks a graphical user
                  interface (GUI). Many organizations opt for customized
                  command-line tools to accomplish various tasks quickly and
                  efficiently.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Creating command-line tools with Node.js is simple, efficient,
                  and quick, thanks to various libraries available, such as
                  commander, yargs, and oclif. Also, this runtime environment
                  encourages developers with no proficiency in back-end
                  languages to use JavaScript.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h3><strong>Embedded Systems&nbsp;</strong></h3>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  An embedded system is a microcontroller- or
                  microprocessor-based system, which is an amalgamation of
                  hardware and software to perform a particular or dedicated
                  function within larger systems.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Doesn&rsquo;t it sound strange to use JavaScript for creating
                  microcontroller-based applications? It absolutely does!
                  However, hardware programming is emerging as one of the most
                  popular use cases of Node.js.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  More interestingly, you can now install and run Node.js on
                  low-cost, energy-efficient microcontroller boards, thanks to
                  its version, low.js.&nbsp;
                </p>

                  sensors, beacons, software, and other technologies, that can
                  exchange information over the internet.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                  A single IoT system consists of multiple devices. The ability
                  of Node.js to process multiple requests at the same time and
                  the event-driven architecture that facilitates asynchronous
                  data processing make it a better choice for building IoT
                  applications. In addition, this environment acts as an
                  application layer between IoT devices and databases to store
                  information generated by those devices.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

                <p>
                  Here ends our discussion on the applications of Node.js. It is
                  a versatile, scalable, and fast runtime environment running on
                  top of the V8 engine. Many leading tech gains, including
                  Netflix, Uber, GoDaddy, LinkedIn, and PayPal, have implemented
                  this runtime environment.&nbsp;
